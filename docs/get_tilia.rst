Obtaining & Installing Tilia
========================================

Obtaining Tilia
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Eric C. Grimm developed and improved Tilia throughout his career, and you can learn more about Tilia at his primary website. 

.. _TiliaIT : http://tiliait.com

However, Eric passed away in November 2020 right as the database was transitioning from a Microsoft SQL to PostgreSQL. An updated version of Tilia was in development at that time, and the Neotoma IT team released an updated beta version (v3.0.1) of Tilia that interfaces with the  PostgreSQL shortly after Eric's passing. At this time, you can download Tilia here:

.. _Tilia v3.0.1 : https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1uwElEFwc2imp_xQDOVnR1BWInCCwww8x

Once the ZIP file is downloaded it can be opened using a program such as WinRAR, 7ZIP or WinZip.  The downloaded file contains a single file *setup_tilia_X_Y_ZZZ.exe* (where the X, Y and ZZZ represent the version numbering).  This file is an executable that will lead you through the setup process.  Tilia is built for Windows, but can be installed on Macintosh Brand or Linux system using an emulator.


Installing Tilia on a Macintosh or Linux Machine
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Tilia is built on a platform that requires the use of Windows.  Given its popularity however, people have found solutions for using the software on multiple platforms.

Installing Tilia on a Macintosh

*The following instructions were kindly provided by `Jonathan Nichols`_:*
To run Tilia on an OSX machine, the following programs must be installed:

* WINE_ for Darwin and OSX.
* XQuartz_ (or X11 if you are using OSX 10.5 or older) must be installed.

Once Wine and XQuartz (or X11) are installed and running, navigate to the “Start” menu in Wine and select “Run”
