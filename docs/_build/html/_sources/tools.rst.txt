Tools
===============================================

Tilia provides a number of tools, built in as part of the program.  These tools include.

Chronology Builder
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Tools > Chronology** becomes available when you navigate to the `Data Tab`_.  This tool allows you to build a new chronology (or replicate a published chronology).  You have the option of building a new chronology using one of five methods (linear, polynomial, cubic spline, cubic b-spline, and LOWESS curves), each with their own set of parameters.
