Creating a New Tilia File
========================================

Open up the Tilia program and open a new file (**File** > **New**).  A new window will open up, with two tabs at the top (Data & Metadata), several columns (Code, Name and Group) and a single header cell, by default **Pollen**.

   A brand new empty data file.

The cell that contains the term **Pollen** can be modified to represent one of the other dataset types that Neotoma supports.  Once you have selected the dataset type, itâ€™s possible to then load the lookup files that Tilia uses to standardize taxonomy and other associated sample information.

Navigating Tilia
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

While using Tilia there are some features that are found across the data input & manipulation process.  These include editing tools, the menu bar & menu icons, and formatting tools.

Menu Bar
